*Title: Exploratory Data Analysis and Racing Bar Plot for Electric Vehicles*

*Introduction:*
This GitHub report presents a series of Python code snippets for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) and creating a Racing Bar Plot to visualize the sales of different EV makers over the years. The code leverages the `pandas`, `plotly.express`, and `bar-chart-race` libraries to perform the analysis and create visualizations.

*Code Snippet 1 - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis using plotly.express:*
The first code snippet performs univariate analysis by creating a histogram to show the count of each type of electric vehicle. Additionally, a scatter plot is generated to visualize the relationship between electric range and base MSRP, colored by the type of electric vehicle.

*Code Snippet 2 - Choropleth Plots:*
In this snippet, two choropleth plots are created. The first choropleth plot displays the number of electric vehicles based on their electric range in each state. The second plot is an animated choropleth plot that shows the change in base MSRP of electric vehicles by state for each year.

*Code Snippet 3 - Racing Bar Plot:*
This code snippet prepares the data and creates a Racing Bar Plot to visualize the year-wise sales count of each electric vehicle maker. The Racing Bar Plot is created using the `bar-chart-race` library, showcasing the changing ranks of EV makers over the years.

*Conclusion:*
The code snippets presented in this GitHub report showcase the usage of Python libraries like `pandas`, `plotly.express`, and `bar-chart-race` for Exploratory Data Analysis and data visualization of electric vehicle-related data. These visualizations provide valuable insights into the trends, patterns, and popularity of electric vehicles over time. By using the power of Python and these libraries, we can gain a deeper understanding of electric vehicle data and make data-driven decisions in the domain of electric mobility
